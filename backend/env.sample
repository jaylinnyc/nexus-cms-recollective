# Google OAuth2 Client ID
# Obtain this from the Google Cloud Console (APIs & Services > Credentials > OAuth 2.0 Client ID).
# Example: 123456789012-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id

# Google OAuth2 Client Secret
# Obtain this from the same OAuth 2.0 Client ID configuration in the Google Cloud Console.
# Example: GOCSPX-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret

# Redirect URI for OAuth2 callback
# This is the URL Google redirects to after authentication. It must match an Authorized redirect URI
# in the Google Cloud Console. Use the production URL for deployment or a local URL (e.g., http://localhost:8000/auth/google/callback) for testing.
# Example: https://api.recollectivect.com/auth/google/callback
REDIRECT_URI=https://api.recollectivect.com/auth/google/callback

# Allowed email or domain for OAuth2 authentication
# Specifies which Google account(s) can authenticate during initialization.
# - Set to a specific email (e.g., nexus.admin@recollectivect.com) to restrict to one account.
# - Set to a domain (e.g., @recollectivect.com) to allow any email in that domain.
# - Leave empty (ALLOWED_EMAIL=) or omit to allow any Google account (no restriction).
# Example: nexus.admin@recollectivect.com, @recollectivect.com, or ""
ALLOWED_EMAIL=nexus.admin@recollectivect.com
